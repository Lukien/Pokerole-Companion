# ðŸŽ² PokÃ©role Companion ðŸŽ²

A utility for the PokÃ©role system.

## A very quick and visible disclaimer
I am not a programmer by trade. I built this because I wanted to. It's probably FILLED with bugs. Back up your trainer data every once in a while. I'd like to rewrite this at some point using the things I've learned, but that will come later.
